# Alberto Moleiro Website

Welcome to my personal web project. This is a project made with Html, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. You can visit the website at this link https://albertomoleiro.dev. Thank you for visiting.


# Project objective

This project has been made with the purpose of finding work as a developer. For this reason, It has the objective of shown a little of my experience and studies in web development. It gives to anyone, who would be interested in me, the means to contact me. 


# Development process

This project has been made while learning JavaScript. The project should not be taken as an example of good practice. The code has been completely made by me, although I must thank the knowledge about canvas animation to the YouTube channel https://www.youtube.com/@Frankslaboratory


# Acknowledgements

I must thank the free resources given by the https://bevouliin.com page, which have helped me to animate my website.
